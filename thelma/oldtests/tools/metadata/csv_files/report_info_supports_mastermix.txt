FORMULAS
--------

ISO volume and ISO concentration have been calculated by the system.


The minimum ISO volume is determined using the following formula:

    isoVolume = ( (No(tw) * nr * transferVolume) + deadVolume) / (2 * ODF)

    where

    isoVolume - is the determined ISO volume
    No(tw) - is the total number of target wells in all cell plates (without replicates)
    nr - is the number of (interplate) replicates (here: 3)
    transferVolume - is the mastermix volume transfer into each cell plate well (5 ul)
    deadVolume* - is the deadVolume of a ISO plate well (see below)
    ODF - is the OptiMem dilution factor (3 or 4 depending on the molecule type).

    If the isoVolume is smaller than the allowed minimum ISO volume (1 ul)
    it is replaced by the minimum volume. The isoVolume is rounded to
    one decimal place.


    * The dead volume is calculated dynamically depending on the number
    of cell plate wells that obtain volumes from an ISO position. It is
    at least 10 ul. For each well above 3 target wells an additional
    amount of 1 ul is added to the dead volume, up to a maximum dead
    volume of 30 ul.



The ISO concentration is determined using the following formula:

    isoConcentration = finalConcentration * (RDF * CDF * ODF)

    where

    isoConcentration - the concentration ordered from the stock (in nM)
    finalConcentration - is the final concentration in the cell plate (in nM)
    RDF - is the transfection reagent dilution factor (2)
    CDF - is the cell suspension dilution factor (7)
    ODF - is the OptiMem dilution factor (3 or 4 depending on the molecule type).

    The isoConcentration is rounded to one decimal place.

Experiment Metadata Generator - You did not specify an ISO request layout. The system will try to generate the layout by itself.
